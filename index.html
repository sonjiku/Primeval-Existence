				<h1>About the project...</h1>
				<p>
					Primeval Existence is a black metal project,
					started by Oculus Antiquus and Blasphemus Prophet in
					Rethymno. The band consisted of Oculus, Blasphemus
					Prophet, Amnesiac and Unholy Grandpa
					(of Flesh Martyr and CHAOSHORDE). After recording
					their first song that was supposed to be realeased,
					Oculus disbanded the project due to creative differences
					and the difficulty of all members to put time into it
					because of life obligations.
				</p>

				<p>
					After 2 years of inactivity, Oculus decided to continue
					working on the project in 2020, and started working towards
					releasing an EP with the previously recorded single, and 3
					more songs written by him and some help from the previous
					members.

				<h1>Latest Song</h1>
				<p>
					Fiend Is the first song ever released by the project.
					It was recorded in 2017 by Oculus, in his family home
					in Rethymno. The song has been stayed on a hard drive
					for over 4 years. It’s finally time for the world to
					be blessed by the blood gurgling sounds of Oculus’ screams.
